# Toolbox App - https://toolbox-dcedraz.herokuapp.com/

This application is a work in progress as I keep learning more about Ruby on Rails.

## Scope of the project:

### Encode converter

Build an app that allows to convert any file to UTF-8, displaying the characters encode differences.

**TODO list:**

[X] Form validation

[X] Bug: Unable to process file too big. Solved, not using "read" method anymore. 

[ ] Install Charlock_Holmes gem.

## XML/JSON converter

Build an app that allows to upload a XML file and transform it into JSON.
