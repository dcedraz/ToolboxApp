# Toolbox App

This application is a work in progress as I keep learning more about Ruby on Rails.

## Scope of the project:

### Encode converter

Build an app that allows to convert any file to UTF-8, displaying the characters encode differences.

**TODO list:**

[X] Form validation

[ ] Bug: Unable to process file too big. Might need to stop reading on memory and save the file temporary.

[ ] Configure Rails Active Storage to store the files uploaded in the cloud somewhere to be defined yet.

## XML/JSON converter

Build an app that allows to upload a XML file and transform it into JSON.
